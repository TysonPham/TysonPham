### Greetings 👋

<!--
**TysonPham/TysonPham** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I am currently pursuing a bachelor in Software Engineering at Concordia University :mortar_board:
Here are some ideas to get you started:


- 🌱 I am passionate about the backend aspect of programming
- 💻 Casually looking for **Fall 2021** internship opportunities
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play badminton, practise martial arts and volunteer at a cat shelter :cat:
